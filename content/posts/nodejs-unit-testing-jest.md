Reliable software requires rigorous testing. In the Node.js ecosystem, **Jest** and **Supertest** form a powerful combination for testing RESTful APIs without needing to spin up a live server.

### What is Covered?

In this article, I demonstrate how to write integration tests for your API endpoints.

1.  **Setting up the Test Environment**: Configuring Jest for a Node.js project.
2.  **Supertest Basics**: How to simulate HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) against your Express app.
3.  **Assertions**: Verifying response status codes, headers, and JSON bodies.
4.  **Mocking**: Tips for isolating your tests from external dependencies (databases, third-party services).

Testing is not just about finding bugs; it's about documenting how your API is expected to behave and allowing you to refactor with confidence.
